# Seed Modifier

Seed Modifier is a BepInEx plugin for Content Warning that gives the player control over the randomized in-game seed.

As of v0.4 (latest) the plugin does not modify where the diving bell spawns, altho if anyone wants to help me out with this shoot me a DM on Discord - **_crxw**

# Config

The config file is generated upon first launch of the game. There is only one modifiable value, that being the seed.
The seed can be anything between **1 and 2147483647**. If the seed is set to **0** the plugin will not change the in-game seed and will leave it to be random.

# Install

To install the plugin you'll need BepInEx and then drag'n'drop the SeedModifier.dll into the BepInEx/Plugins folder.
